ANT is a tool for building single-agent, rule based systems. It consists of a
rule based language for the problem definitions, a basic pattern matching
engine and different selectable algorithms for general problem solving.

It is useful when trying to solve problems where the initial and final state
are known as well as the rules to manipulate states, but the steps (the order
the rules should be applied) for going from the initial to the final step are
unknown.

ANT was born as a simple university project: that means that many things have
been simplified (the matching algorithm is far from being efficient compared
to real world alternatives like CLIPS) and many aspects of good software
development (like unit tests) have been neglecteds due to rigid time
constraints. As such, the documentation is exhaustive but it is written
entirely in italian.

CMake is required to build ANT. The following instruction set should be enough
to get ANT compiled, assuming that CMake is correctly installed:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

The compiled output named 'ant' will be under the build/src directory.
